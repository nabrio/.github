# Nabrio

Nabrio's mission is to make AI-powered automation accessible to everyone, as traditional AI automation can be complex, expensive, time-consuming and often requiring specialised expertise across domains.

To achieve this goal, Nabrio has been developing two key platforms:

Zene: This platform gathers data from IoT devices and analyses them using AI models. Based on the results, Zene makes decisions and performs external tasks. The platform also displays the information on an integrated dashboard. Zene is designed to be cost-effective with edge-based processing and simple with a low-code interface, allowing anyone to master the automation process.

Reva: This platform is responsible for managing and automating the end-to-end AI training process. It ensures that the models are always up-to-date and performing at their best, helping to maintain the accuracy and effectiveness of the AI-powered automation. Reva's simplicity of use is ensured through its no-code interface, auto-labelling, and model fine-tuning capabilities, as well as seamless deployment to Zene.

By providing these user-friendly, cost-effective tools, Nabrio aims to make AI-powered automation accessible to a wide range of individuals and organisations, regardless of their technical expertise.
